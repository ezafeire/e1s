# E1S - Easily Manage AWS ECS Resources in Terminal üê±‚ú®

`e1s` is a terminal application to easily browsing and manage AWS ECS resources, with a focus on [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate). Inspired by [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s).

## AWS credentials and configuration

`e1s` uses the default [aws-cli configuration](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/develop/README.rst#configuration). It does not store or send your access and secret key anywhere. The access and secret key are used only to securely connect to AWS API via AWS SDK. Both profile and region are overridable via the `AWS_PROFILE` and `AWS_REGION`.

## Installation

e1s is available on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.

- Binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac are available in the [release](https://github.com/keidarcy/e1s/releases) page.
- Via Homebrew for maxOS or Linux

```bash
brew install keidarcy/tap/e1s
```
